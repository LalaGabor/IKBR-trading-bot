Tests DB

Test 1. Connection to db exists (engine exists)
--Done
Test 2. Can insert data (test via reading inserted data). Use dummy data. Insert it into table. Assert that inserted table exists (via read query).
-- Not necessary (covered in next test)
Test 3. Test deduplication function. Test that delete query correctly impacts table (insert dummy data with duplicates on the target date). assert that it is inserted (via read query)
-- Done
Test 4. Test append function. Test that append query correctly impacts table (inserts dummy data, assert that read from table after insert returns xyz)
-- Done
Test5. Test append function. Test that columns have expected type. Get expected types from dummy data.
-- skipped
Test 6. Test drop table function. Test that targeted tables are dropped. First insert dummy tables, then target those dummy tables with the function.
--add a symbol to the list of symbols. add a table for that symbol. then drop the table for that symbol using function. assert that it is dropped. delete dummy symbol list of symbols
--Done
Test 7. Test update table function. Test that targeted tables are updated.
-- Read in some dummy data from a csv. -- Done
-- Use dummy data in database_manager fixture -- Done
-- Get dummy data into DB  -- Done
-- Set the dummy data 'is_divergence_open' = 1 at the targeted row (row_number - 5) --Done
-- run the function to update table in db. assert that it is updated. -- Done
-- revert any changes to the dummy data -- Done

Tests Historical data

Test 1. Test process historical data. Set self.bot.df_dict[symbol] to be empty. Assert that new_index = 0
-- Done
Test 2. Test process historical data. Set self.bot.df_dict[symbol] to be not empty. Assert that new_index = self.bot.df_dict[symbol].index[-1] + 1
-- Done
Test 3. Test process historical data. Set self.bot.df_dict[symbol] to be not empty. Assert that self.bot.df_dict[symbol].loc[new_index] = passed dummy data (via bar argument)
-- Done

Realtime Data Tests

Test 1. Test process realtime data. Test new data for existing date field. Pass dummy data. Assert that columns match expected values. Delete added dummy data
-- In progress
Test 1. Test process realtime data. Test new data for non existing date field. Pass dummy data. Assert that columns match expected values. Delete added dummy data

Tests Client Manager

None relevant identified.
Test that incoming historical/realtime data arrives? Should be in bot section
Test that connection is established? Should be in bot section

Order Manager Tests

Test 1. Test place order. Test that profit_target and stop_loss calculated correctly. Assert that it equals values 1,2,3. Use dummy data
Test 2. Test place order. Test that order_id has iterated correctly. Assert that it equals values 1,2,3. Use dummy data
Test 3. Test place order. Test placing order. Using sample/dummy data place an order. Assert that get_order_status returns a placed order
